# Real Time Bus Tracker


## Real-time locations of MBTA's transportation

### Description of the project

The project teaches how to work with Mapbox mapping library to pull in data asynchronously and display map elements.
It is also illustrates how to use MBTA API to source real-time data of the Boston MBTA buses and how to use mapping libraries to display 
the live location of the busses on a map. 
 

### How to Run
- Sign up for an account with Mapbox and generate your own API key
- Replace YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY text with your API key in mapanimation.js
- Load index.html in a browser
- Once the pages is loaded, select the route to track from the drop-down list located in the left upper corner
- The locations of the vehicles (buses or trains) are refreshed every 15 seconds


### Improvements made so far

- Created a dropdown list allowing to select any available MBTA's route to track
- Added popup to the markers showing the route name, status and stop station related of the tracked vehicle


### Roadmap of future improvements
Curently I do not plan any further activities in this repository.
